## **Sophia's BUDGET CALCULATOR.**

### Project Description.

This repository contains resources on a budget calculator. The repository contains an automated budget spreadsheet which was used in the analysis of Sophia Ahuoyiza's expenses in 2021. The project is hosted on Excel's Spreadsheet package, we used this tool because of it's analytics features which help to summarize data.

### Case Study
Sophia is a program manager at a fintech company, she is paid 1,200,000 million monthly and loves the baby girl lifestyle. The problem with this is that her savings cannot fund this lifestyle of hers as she spends excessively. This led to our contract project where sophia had to get us involved to help her track her expenses.
